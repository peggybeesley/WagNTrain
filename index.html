            <p>
                <abbr title="Wag-N-Train">Wag-N-Train Pet Sitting</abbr> was founded by JaNae Jackman in 2015.
                Wag-N-Tails was an idea JaNae had while she was in 6th grade to start a dog walking business. Since then, this idea has evolved and grown strong!
                At Wag-N-Tails, our goal is to provide caring, competent, and competitive care
                for all of your pet and house sitting needs. Please contact us for more information!
